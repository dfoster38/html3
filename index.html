	<article>TOO RAD is a unisex brand that brings about poppy, unique styles that are casual and more of a skater type of appeal. All designs start off hand drawn, then scanned to make a digital copy. They are then edited online using Adobe Photoshop and examined down to every pixel, making sure lines are sharp, colors are picked to be bold and vibrant and to ensure final products come out sharp and bright. When printed, the ink is made to last hundreds of washes without fading or cracking like most brands, and clothing is made on 100% cotton material that has already been pre-shrunk, so customers never have to worry about any changing of size while being washed or dried. These items are meant to just be casual and bold at the same time while unique and colorful. Local "pop-up"s" happen often at local events (San Antonio, Austin) where other vendors and artists come out, such as at Imagine Books and Records.
